# Land-Use-Land-Cover-GIS

This project focuses on land-use and land-cover classification using ArcGIS Pro and Google Earth Pro, employing supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. During classification, several challenges were encountered:

Urban areas and barren land exhibited similar spectral signatures, making differentiation difficult.

Dry riverbeds reflected similar signatures to urban areas and barren land, leading to misclassification.

Adjusting urban classification introduced errors in barren land classification due to spectral overlap.

Hilly terrain posed challenges in forest classification, especially in shadowed regions.

To address these issues, additional post-processing techniques were applied, and a new class was introduced after final analysis to improve accuracy and better distinguish between ambiguous land cover types.
